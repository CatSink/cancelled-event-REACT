## Description

Canceling plans has always been a source of anxiety, even when both sides don’t want to go. Our application is made with cancelling in mind. 

We wanted a way to Cancel plans with a group, or even with one friend, that isn’t weird or hard. We also wanted an easier way to make plans more detailed so people know not just where to go and when, but things like what to wear and how much money the group is planning to spend.

This project is a collaborative MERN full-stack application. The Cancelled application provides a simple way to create and plan events and invites, and shamelessly cancel if things change.

Let’s say you made plans to go out with a friend, but the day of you’re in bed and realize you just want to stay there. You can hit cancel on your plans without the other person ever knowing you want to cancel. BUT if they also hit cancel, the plans are then officially cancelled and both friends are notified.
