## Description

Canceling plans has always been a source of anxiety, even when both sides don’t want to go. Our application is made with cancelling in mind. 

We wanted a way to Cancel plans with a group, or even with one friend, that isn’t weird or hard. We also wanted an easier way to make plans more detailed so people know not just where to go and when, but things like what to wear and how much money the group is planning to spend.

This project is a collaborative MERN full-stack application. The Cancelled application provides a simple way to create and plan events and invites, and shamelessly cancel if things change.

The project includes MongoDB, Express, React, GraphQL and Apollo Server, check out the package.json for more details on specific libraries used. We wanted to create an application that makes it easy to connect with friends for various events and share details of plans and committment level. We had some challenges that we will continue to resolve. Stay tuned for updates.
